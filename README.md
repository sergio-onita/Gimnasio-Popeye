# Gimnasio-Popeye
This is a fitness center software demo developed for my Software Engineering Course.
The project was developed using Netbeans IDE v12.5.

Before running the program, main class has to be setted up.
For this, go to Project Properties, Run Section, then add "ventanas.Principal" as main class and save changes pressing OK. 
Project is ready to run.

There are different type of employees, all of them are instantiated in the same main class, where username and password can be checked to access.
